            "description": "A PALE MOSAIC is our American style IPA showcasing a fairly new hop variety called Mosaic. The beer begins with a base of German Pale Ale and Vienna malts, and is brewed for a light, crisp malt body. We use Oregon grown hops for bittering, targeting 50 IBU\u2019s, and follow that up with a hefty whirlpool addition. Finally we dry-hop with Mosaic, Simcoe and Nugget to deliver a beer that is clean and complex with notes of pine resin, grapefruit pith and blueberries.",

We blend that with a small amount of Vienna and Caramel malts to add distinct character and mouthfeel and then mash strategically for both attenuation and a balanced malty sweetness. Throughout the boil we use a blend of Summit, Columbus and Cascade to lend flavors of resinous fruit and dank pine. The kettle hop additions provide an enticing aroma and noticeable but balanced bitterness and we dry hop in the fermenter to deliver a mouthful of hoppiness.",

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",

Zoe is based on pale and vienna malts, light to golden in color with a beautiful white layer of foam resting on top, constantly delivering floral and citrus dry-hop aromatics with every sip. With notes of lightly toasted bread, floral hops and an incredibly smooth finish we hope that Zoe is everything that you\u2019ve been searching for in a pale lager.",
