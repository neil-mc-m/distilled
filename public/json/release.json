        "description": "A hop bomb IPA brewed with Tap 25 for their anniversary.  A few things were in mind when making  this beer; double IPA, make it hoppy, and make it crushable. With Pilsner being the predominant malt, this double IPA is light in body, and easy to drink.  Loads of Columbus, Exp. 07270, Centennial, Simcoe, and Mosaic give this beer and danky, citrusy, and fruity hop flavor and aroma. 8.0% ABV",

            "description": "Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident. They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",
